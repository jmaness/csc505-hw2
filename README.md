# Overview
This repository consists of all work for the 2019 CSC 505 HW2 assignment.

# Collaboration workflow
I recommend using Gitflow as a means for us to collaborate as we write proofs and source code for programming assignment. You can read about Gitflow at https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow.

Essentially, for a homework answer (or even just part of an answer), create a feature branch off of the `develop` branch, make your changes, push them up to origin, and open a pull request (PR). This can allow us to make comments and update the answer before merging into the `develop` branch.

Even after the change is merged to `develop`, we can always make future changes. When we feel comfortable that a particular problem is complete, we can perform a "release" by merging to `master`.

Initially, this might seem like unnecessary overhead, but in practice, it's a pretty efficient process, and I've used it for a number of years in industry.
